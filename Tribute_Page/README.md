<strong>Hello All !</strong>

A tribute page is an overview of someone whom I admire in my life. In this article, I created a tribute webpage of the Late Kobe Bryant using HTML and CSS. The page features a clean and visually appealing design, incorporating a header with a centered title, a main section with content including text and image, and a footer for additional information or credits.

Approach:
- In the 'body' element, I will give the title of the page using the h1 tag after that I will add an image of him in the img tag with the caption. I will create another div tag and write all the contents (using 'p' tags).
- I have also given an ID for each tag so that I can beautify the design using the respective ID in the CSS file.
- In the CSS section, I have maintained a central design and used box-shadow to create a box effect around the main content.
