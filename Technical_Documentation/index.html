                    - An operating system acts as a bridge between software and hardware. <br />
                    - Without an operating system, software can't directly communicate with hardware.<br />
                    - The user installs software on their server, which communicates with the operating system, which then communicates with the hardware.<br />
                    - Examples of popular operating systems are Windows, Mac, and Linux.
